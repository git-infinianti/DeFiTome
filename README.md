## 🎯 Mission

DeFi Tome unlocks Evrmore's untapped liquidity and native on-chain capabilities by delivering a **complete, trustless DeFi ecosystem**—from peer-to-peer trading and lending to yield farming and cross-chain interoperability—without intermediaries or compromises.

We're building **Solidity for Evrmore**: a purpose-built smart contract language that leverages Evrmore's unique architecture to deliver unmatched performance, security, and composability.

## ⚡ Why DeFi Tome?

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **100% On-Chain** | All operations execute directly on Evrmore—no wrapped tokens, no bridges, no trusted custodians |
| **Native P2P** | True peer-to-peer interactions eliminate protocol rent-seeking |
| **Evrmore-Optimized** | Custom Solidity variant exploits Evrmore's architecture for lower fees & higher throughput |
| **Composable** | Modular design enables seamless protocol stacking (e.g., swap → lend → yield farm in one tx) |
| **Community-Owned** | Open-source, decentralized governance ready |

## 🏗️ Architecture

### Core Stack
- **Backend**: Django 6.0 (Python) + PostgreSQL/SQLite
- **Frontend**: HTML5, JavaScript (vanilla + modern tooling)
- **Blockchain Integration**: Evrmore RPC, native cryptographic libraries
- **Decentralized Storage**: IPFS for protocol data, smart contract ABIs, governance records
- **Content Delivery**: Cloudflare for global performance & DDoS protection
- **Infrastructure**: AWS (file uploads, user data backup)

### Domain-Specific Modules

## 🚀 Feature Set (Alpha → Production)

### Trading & Exchange
- **Peer-to-Peer Swaps** — Direct token trades without AMM fees
- **Liquidity Pools** — Community-provided liquidity with fair fee distribution
- **Order Book DEX** — Limit orders, market orders, stop-loss execution
- **Price Feeds** — Decentralized oracle network (testnet v1)

### Lending & Borrowing
- **Collateralized Lending** — Earn interest on deposits, borrow against collateral
- **Liquidation Engine** — Real-time price monitoring and automated liquidations
- **Variable/Fixed Rates** — Dynamic interest curves or fixed-term instruments

### Yield & Farming
- **Yield Aggregation** — Route liquidity to highest-yield strategies
- **Governance Rewards** — Incentivize participation in protocol decisions
- **Strategy Vaults** — Automated rebalancing and compounding

### Cross-Protocol Composability
- **Flash Loans** — Uncollateralized, single-transaction borrowing
- **Protocol Aggregation** — Route transactions through optimal paths
- **Governance** — DAO-controlled parameter updates
